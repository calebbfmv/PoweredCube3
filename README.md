Bukkit with a twist: No Notch code to be seen!
Supporting:
- MC Protocol 1.7.4
- Bukkit version R1.7.2-R0.2

This is a complete recode of the Minecraft server (a.k.a no notch code.)
We are supporting the Bukkit API as well, so all your old Bukkit plugins should work fine,
as long as they don't use NMS.

Currently working on:
- Item breaking
  - Currently causes client-side error, packet size > limit

TODO:
- Proper entity support
- NBT support
- Inventory management
- Better world generation
- Full implementation of protocol
- Survival mode implementation
- Implementing full Bukkit API
- Adding actions to blocks

We need your help!
We cannot do this on our own - every bitof help counts!

This was coded using Intellj IDEA, so you will need that to contribute.
