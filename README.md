Bukkit with a twist: No Notch code to be seen!
Supporting:
- MC Protocol 1.7.4
- Bukkit version R1.7.2-R0.3

This is a complete recode of the Minecraft server (a.k.a no notch code.)
We are supporting the Bukkit API as well, so all your old Bukkit plugins should work fine,
as long as they don't use NMS.

Currently working on:
- Inventory management - movement, crafting, and so on
  - Need to add protocol support

TODO:
- ** Chunk-per-chunk loading (vs currently whole world loading)
- ** Ability to see other players
- NBT support
- Better world generation
- Full implementation of protocol
- Survival mode implementation (health, hunger)
- Implementing full Bukkit API
  - "Fill in the blanks"
  - Commands
  - Full event implementation
- Adding actions to blocks
- Implementing mobs

We need your help!
We cannot do this on our own - every bit of help counts!

This was coded using Intellj IDEA, so you will need that to contribute.
